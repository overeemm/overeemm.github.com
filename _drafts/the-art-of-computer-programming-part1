I have these books on my shelve since graduation (2007), and a couple of weeks ago I finally set the goal to actually read them. 
So in these series I will summarize, share notes, and tell the world about my progress.

These books are impressive. 
And to be honest a little intimidating. 
I like reading and learning, but I'm not sure if I can follow all this stuff. 
But we will see.

### sections 1.1 and 1.2

_I read the Third Edition of Volume 1_

Section 1.1 is labeled __Algorithms__. The first section was fun. 
Some history mixed with some background on algorithms. 
Background such as the origin of the word _algorithm_. 
I sure didn't know that its origins are in the name of the Persian author [al-Khwārizmī][1].

Section 1.2 is __Mathematical Preliminaries__ and for this section I followed the advise of Knuth.
I skimmed these sections, familiarized myself with the things I already learned and read some new stuff.
I did not do any exercises.
To be honest, I am more interested in the computer programming parts and less in the math part.
The subsections of 1.2 covered numbers, powers, logarithms, sums, products, integer functions, permutations, factorials, n over k, harmonic numbers, fibonacci, generating functions, the analysis of algorithms, and asymptotic representations.

The last subsection was interesting as it covered the [big-O notation][2].
And it made my think about another book in my digital shelve: [The Imposter’s Handbook][3].
In this book Rob Conery dives into all kinds of computer science topics for those who never studied computer science.
And to be honest, his explanations also make sence for the ones that did study computer science (yep, that's me).
In this case I read Knuth's subsection and after that I read what Rob Conery said about it.
Knuth is pure with all the math, while Rob gives an overview, but they inforce each other and I am good to go :)
