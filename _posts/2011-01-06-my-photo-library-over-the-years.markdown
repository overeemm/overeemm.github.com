title: My photo library over the years
tags: [photo's]

After reading Hanselmans blog I became curious. How does my photo library look?
 
The journey, or better adventure, started with seeing if I could get those statistics from my library. I use iPhoto to manage all my photo's, but it doesn't come with these kind of statistics. I does have some .xml file, so I thought lets use XSLT. But no, the necessary information (like resolution) is not in this .xml file.
Next step was to do it myself. So after copying everything to a Windows environment (yes, I do use Windows and I like Visual Studio and C#) I started to do some gathering. The opensource library jpegdata came to the rescue.
 
But then you also want to view charts, right? Nobody wants to look at some numbers. So I dove into google charts to generate some nice pictures. And the result is:
 
number of photo's per year
 
number of photos per resolution (megapixels)
 
average resolution per year
 
 
So what does this tell me? 

- I don't invest a lot in camera's (I often make photo's with my iPhone), so the resolution does not increase a lot.
- I probably need to clean up my library, because there was a lot of garbage in it :-)

 
 Again, not very interesting, but a fun exercise.
