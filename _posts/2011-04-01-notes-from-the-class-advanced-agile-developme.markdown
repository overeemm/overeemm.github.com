title: Notes from the class Advanced Agile Development
categories: [agile, craft]
---
Last week I attended the Advanced Agile Development class, organised by Xebia and given by Alistair Cockburn. With this post, I try to make my notes persistent for future reference.

_these are my notes. they are far from complete. as seen from this tweet, the class was really advanced :)_

But I did survive!

### Content

+ __craft__; deepening (life long learning) skills in a medium (for instance a progr language); shu-ha-ri
+ __cooperative game__; all about strategies (invent, decide, communicate)
+ __flow management__; manufacturing lines; palette size
+ __self awareness/ personalities__; everybody is different, look at the personalities in your team
+ __design as a knowledge acquisition__; try to get as much knowledge as you can with every step

### Craft

Learning takes place in three stages: 
+ __SHU__ - learn a skill; copying a technique step by step
+ __HA__ - collect techniques; search for other techniques to try.
+ __RI__ - blend and invent techniques; knowledge and experience are combined into something new

Do not try to become __RI__ without really archiving that level. Otherwise you are just picking techniques and doing something that you do not understand.
 
__good trick > technique > process > dogma__
It starts with a 'good trick', that becomes a technique, which is formulated into a process and that becomes a dogma. You have to bring everything back to a 'good trick'. There are no rules. Master agile and reach RI level.
 
## Cooperative game
The speed of the project is the speed at which ideas move between minds
+ what are conditions to facilitate speed: colocation, ...
+ attitude: ego, fear, self preservation, ...

Programming is Community Theory Building
Communication is touching into shared experiences

Development is a cooperative game: Invent, Decide, Communicate
primary goal: deliver working software
secondary goal: set up for the next game (maintenaince, new release)

### Flow management
Design looks like manufacturing if we use 'decisions' as inventory. Let the decisions flow through the team. Find the bottleneck and fix the process.

_Remove waste. Example: tracking bugs is waste, we need to fix them._

### Design is knowledge acquisition

Software development is like knowledge acquisition. Eliminate risks early on.
+ __business risk__: are we building the right thing
+ __social risk__:  can they/we build it
+ __technical risk__: performance, compatibility
+ __cost schedule risk__: see if features change the costs of other parts of the project.
 
trim the tail: first do risk, then do value, then do the fine-tuning/glossy/polishing
slicing helps with trimming the tail; build complete vertical-slices of user stories.
 
### Properties of success projects

+ __frequent delivery__; quick visible progress; stakeholders can give feedback; little steps so little errors
+ __reflective improvement__; evaluate to improve
+ __close/osmotic communication__; communication should be easy, everybody should be involved
+ __personal safety__; willing to listen to others & ability to speak without fear to be damaged; trust for everybody to be part of the team
+ __focus__; knowing what to work on, having time to work on it; distraction
+ __easy access to expert users__; quick and better feedback on decisions
+ __technical environment__; trust to try stuff out; unit tests/ CI/ version control
+ __sunshine/visibility__; transparency; be honest when failing; motivation
