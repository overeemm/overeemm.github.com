I decided to summarize some JavaScript sources that I use, have used and want to share with others. This is by no means complete, but it might serve as a good starting point. Please, send my anything that I have missed :-)

### Books

This is a short list of all the books that are available on JavaScript. I only wanted to list the books that I have read. I cannot recommend others.

+ [The Good Parts][1] , by Douglas Crockford
+ [JavaScript: the definitive guide][2], by David Flanagan
