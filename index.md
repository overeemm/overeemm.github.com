As an Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.afas.nl/">AFAS</a> I'm responsible for our <a href="https://kleinzakelijk.afas.nl/">SB product</a>, our <a href="https://klant.afas.nl/thema/ai">AI features</a> and <a href="https://www.afas.dev/">DevEx</a>.
I used to write code (mostly in C#), nowadays I design new features, support the development teams, and <a href="/pubspres">give talks or write stuff</a> on our approach.

I have a PhD from <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/software-systems/organization-and-information/labs/software-ecosystems">Utrecht University</a>, I did my research under the supervision of <a href="https://slingerjansen.nl/">Slinger Jansen</a>.
My research focused on low-code development platforms, model-driven development, event sourcing, CQRS, software evolution, and continuous delivery. However, I also have an interest in AI and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2025.112699">chatbot correctness</a>.
