As a Lead Software Architect at <a href="https://www.afas.nl/">AFAS</a> I'm responsible for the generator architecture of our low-code platform.
With our in-house low-code platform we develop our <a href="https://kleinzakelijk.afas.nl/">next gen ERP system (dutch)</a>.
I'm a hands-on architect, so I write code (mostly in C#). 
I do like to <a href="/pubspres">give talks or write stuff</a> on our approach.

As an external PhD candidate at <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/software-systems/organization-and-information/labs/software-ecosystems">Utrecht University</a>, I also conduct research.
My daily supervisor is <a href="https://slingerjansen.nl/">Slinger Jansen</a>.
My research interests are low-code development platforms, model-driven development, event sourcing, CQRS, software evolution, and continuous delivery.
I'm currently finishing my dissertation.

These are my opinions and experiments. The posts are "AS IS", no warranties.
