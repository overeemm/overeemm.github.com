As an Engineering Manager at <a href="https://www.afas.nl/">AFAS</a> I'm responsible for the development team that designs and develops our low-code platform.
With our in-house low-code platform we develop our <a href="https://kleinzakelijk.afas.nl/">next gen ERP system (dutch)</a>.
I used to write code (mostly in C#), nowadays I design new features, support the development teams, and <a href="/pubspres">give talks or write stuff</a> on our approach.

I have a PhD from <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/software-systems/organization-and-information/labs/software-ecosystems">Utrecht University</a>, I did my research under the supervision of <a href="https://slingerjansen.nl/">Slinger Jansen</a>.
My research interests are low-code development platforms, model-driven development, event sourcing, CQRS, software evolution, and continuous delivery.

These are my opinions and experiments. The posts are "AS IS", no warranties.
