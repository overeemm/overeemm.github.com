<h3 class="entry-title">
    API Management Assessment using the API-m-FAMM
</h3>

<p>The API-m-FAMM is a maturity model to asses the API management capabilities of your organization or product.
    The model consists of practices grouped in different capabilities and focus areas.
</p>

<p>Open the <a href="/files/api-m-famm.pdf">visualization</a>, the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10611">full description</a>, 
        or/and the <a href="https://maturitymodels.org/api-management-maturity-matrix-v1-0/">interactive version</a> of the API-m-FAMM to get familiar with the model.
        Every practice has a code consisting of 3 digits (for example <b>1.1.6 ‘Implement API Deprecation Protocol’</b>), 
        where the first digit refers to the focus area the practice is a part of, the second one refers to the capability, and the third digit refers to the maturity level the practice is assigned to. 
        Full descriptions, including the necessary conditions to implement a practice.
</p>

<p>Use the <a href="/files/api-m-famm.xlsx">assesment spreadsheet</a> to asses your organization or product.
    This is a spreadsheet in which you can fill out which practices have been implemented in your organization. 
    The spreadsheet has been structured similarly to the model, with the white cells referring to the individual practices. 
    When clicking on a cell, you will be shown a drop-down menu consisting of 3 options:

    <ul>
        <li><b>Implemented</b>: the practice has currently been implemented within your organization.</li>
        <li><b>Implementable</b>: the practice has not been implemented, but in theory is implementable (when is not important).</li>
        <li><b>Not applicable</b>: the practice has not been implemented, and will never be implemented. 
            This may be caused by a number of reasons. For example, the practice may not be of added value, or not desirable for your organization to implement because it does not align with the organization’s goals, vision, or needs.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Use the Excel spreadsheet and drop-down menu to fill in whether each practice is implemented/implementable or not applicable in your organization. 
</p>

<p>If you have used the API-m-FAMM we kindly ask you to send us your feedback through the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSewgpVOWfIHrJO8G3zCeh61dmjUsUYyEkrM6h7GeATyHEa3YQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">evaluation form</a>.
    This allows us to improve and evolve the API-m-FAMM in the future.
